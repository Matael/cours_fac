How to get a water drop levitating
==================================

Concepts of levitation
----------------------

2 ways :

soit.... soit... : either.... or...

- optical illusion
- real levitation (gravity compensation)

Optical illusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First way : get the observer fall at the same speed as the water drop.
   Just push someone from the top of a tower and send a water drop along with him.
   Everything is about which reference frame you choose.

Second way (less dangerous) : Use a regular dropwise and a stroboscopic light at the same frequency (quite a bit
dephased).
    If you want to make the drops go up and down, just modify this phase shift.

An exemple : VIDEO!

Real Levitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The core concept is to compensate the gravity field.

With optical illusions, we used the gravity to achieve our goals, here, we'll fight against it.

Weightlessness
**************

Weightlessness allow objects to float in air.

A water drop in a spatial station or in a parabolic flight will take off.

Supraconductors
***************

Supraconductor magnets are extremely powerful.

The water has diamagnetic properties particularly interesting so it opposes an equivalent magnetic field to each field going through it.

With that process, we can get a mouse or a frog into levitation.

Acoustic Levitation

Weirdly, we can get a water drop levitating using stationary soundwaves.

Using a transducer, reflector and reflection properties of sound waves, we can create pressure "steps" between nodes and
anti-nodes of pressure.

Then you "just" have to interpose a water drop on one those steps (between two anti-nodes).
